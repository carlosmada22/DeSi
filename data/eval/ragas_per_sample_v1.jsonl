Avoid division-specific codes (e.g., `BAM_FBX.Y_ROOM_TEMPERATURE`) to ensure reusability across projects.  \n\n2. **Reuse Existing Definitions**  \n   Prioritize reusing established entity types (e.g., *Collection*, *Object*, *Dataset*) and controlled vocabularies from other groups. This reduces duplication and ensures alignment with broader standards.  \n\n3. **Use Excel Templates for Organization**  \n   Each entity type (except *Property* types) and controlled vocabulary should be defined in separate Excel files. Include all dependencies (e.g., new vocabularies, scripts) in these files for clarity and ease of review.  \n\n4. **Validate with the Masterdata Checker**  \n   Use the [Masterdata Checker tool](https://mdc.datastore.bam.de/) to verify your definitions before sharing them. This ensures compliance with rules and identifies potential issues.  \n\n5. **Follow Naming and Structure Guidelines**  \n   - Avoid division-specific prefixes in codes or labels.  \n   - Ensure consistency between Excel files and referenced vocabularies (e.g., codes in object type files must match those in controlled vocabulary files).  \n\n6. **Collaborate with Instance Admins**  \n   While Data Store Stewards (DSSt) can draft Masterdata using templates, instance admins are required to register it in openBIS. Share your work via GitHub repositories or email (datastore@bam.de) for review.  \n\nBy adhering to these practices, you ensure Masterdata remains scalable, maintainable, and aligned with the BAM Data Store’s goals.

Spaces have no metadata apart from an ID and a free-text description. User access rights can be defined at the level of individual Spaces. ### Project A Project is a subfolder inside a [Space](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#space) that can contain one or more related [Collections](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#collection). Projects have no metadata apart from an ID and a free-text description.

Dataset types are defined as part of the openBIS masterdata and Datasets of the same type are described by the same set of [Properties](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#property).

Collections are tied to a specific Project and can have properties to describe their contents.\n\n4. **Object**:  \n   The core entity representing physical or immaterial entities (e.g., samples, instruments). Objects have user-defined properties and can belong to a Space, Project, Collection, or exist independently (shared across Spaces).

All existing controlled vocabularies and their terms are listed in the Vocabulary Browser in the Utilities.", "## Defining Entity Types When defining a new entity type of class *Collection*, *Object* or *Dataset*, please check whether a similar entity type (of the same class) already exists that could be reused. If the new entity type is a specification of an existing, more generic entity type then the new, more specific entity type must include all the Sections and *Property* types of the existing entity type. For more information on the concept of inheritance of entity types, see [here](/en/masterdata_definition/best_practices#inheritance-of-entity-types). ### Defining Controlled Vocabularies A controlled vocabulary is an established list of terms to ensure consistency and uniqueness in the description of a given domain, e.g., a list of room labels, SI units or purity grades. In openBIS controlled vocabularies are one possible data type for metadata *Properties*. The vocabulary itself has a **code** and a **description** and each term in the vocabulary has a **code**, a **label**, and a **description**. When defining a new controlled vocabulary, please check whether a similar vocabulary already exists. #### Vocabulary URL Template: Some controlled vocabularies are documented in the web and have unique and persistent identifiers for each term (e.g., a persistent URL or a DOI). In openBIS, it is possible to define a URL template for this type of vocabulary, which represents the vocabulary-specific part of the URL followed by `${term}`. The term-specific part of the URL must be identical to the [term code](/en/masterdata_definition/best_practices#term-code) defined in openBIS.

Here’s a clear breakdown:\n\n### **Key Features of PATs**\n1. **User-Specific & Long-Lived**  \n   - PATs are tied to a specific user and can be long-lived (their validity dates are set at creation). However, they should be rotated periodically for security.\n\n2. **Survive System Restarts**  \n   - Unlike session tokens, PATs persist even after openBIS restarts, ensuring uninterrupted access to data and workflows.\n\n3. **No Password Required**  \n   - PATs eliminate the need to handle user passwords for API interactions. They are generated via the `createPersonalAccessTokens` API method, not through the standard login process.\n\n4. **Session Management**  \n   - Multiple PATs can represent the same session (with the same \"session name\"), enabling seamless transitions when replacing an expiring token without losing state.\n\n5. **Scoped Permissions**  \n   - PATs grant access to the same actions as a user’s session token, **except** for operations involving managing tokens themselves (e.g., creating, listing, or deleting PATs). These actions require a session token instead.\n\n### **Use Cases**\n- **Automated Workflows**: PATs are ideal for scripts or tools that need to interact with openBIS without manual intervention.  \n- **External Integrations**: They simplify secure communication between openBIS and third-party systems via the V3 API.  \n- **Multi-Session Handling**: Multiple PATs with the same session name allow for smooth transitions during token renewal.\n\n### **Limitations**\n- **No Password Sharing**: While PATs avoid password exposure, they must remain confidential (sharing a PAT is equivalent to sharing a user’s credentials).  \n- **No Self-Management**: You cannot use a PAT to create, list, or delete other PATs. These actions require a session token.\n\nIn short, PATs are a flexible, secure, and user-friendly alternative to session tokens for automation and integration, while still adhering to openBIS’s security model.

Standalone webapps are built to\ncompletely replace the original OpenBIS web interface with customer\nadjusted layout and functionality. Users of the standalone webapps are\nusually completely unaware of the default OpenBIS look and feel. The\nwebapp itself provides them with all the functionality they need: login\npages, web forms, searches, images, charts etc. The standalone webapp is\na right choice when you want to build a very specific and fully featured\nweb interface from scratch. If you want to use the default OpenBIS UI\nbut extend it with some custom functionality then embedding a webapp in\nthe OpenBIS UI is probably a way to go. To make a webapp visible as a\npart of the default OpenBIS UI you have to define where the webapp\nshould be shown using “openbisui-contexts” property. Moreover some of\nthe contexts also require additional information describing when the\nwebapp should be shown. For instance, to embed a webapp in the\nexperiment details view that will be displayed for experiments with type\n“MY\\_EXPERIMENT\\_TYPE” your plugin.properties file should look like:", "## Embedding webapps in the OpenBIS UI\n\n### Introduction\n\n**plugin.propeties**\n\n```\nwebapp-folder = html\nopenbisui-contexts = experiment-details-view\nexperiment-entity-types = MY_EXPERIMENT_TYPE\n```\n\n\n\n### Configuring embedded webappsA full list of supported properties is presented below.", "## Embedding webapps in the OpenBIS UI\n\n### Creating embedded webappsEmbedded webapps similar to the standalone counterparts are HTML5\napplications that interact with OpenBIS.

For instance, a webapp that is\ndisplayed in the experiment-details-view context knows that it is\ndisplayed for an experiment entity, with a given type, identifier and\npermid. Having this information the webapp can adjust itself and display\nonly data related to the currently chosen entity.

Once that was done, we could start loading all the necessary V3 API\nclasses and the V3 API facade to make our V3 API calls.\n\nThis approach worked fine, but there were also some drawbacks:\n\n* each V3 API class we wanted to use had to be explicitly “required” and its full class name had to be provided (e.g. as/dto/space/Space)\n* classes were loaded asynchronously making the code using the V3 API more complex\n* every V3 API class was loaded with a separate HTTP request to the server (loading multiple classes resulted in multiple requests to the server)\n* it required a third party dependency manager (here RequireJS)"], "response": "The **V3 API Listener Core Plugin** is a server-side extension for the openBIS system that allows integrators to intercept and modify API operations dynamically. It acts as an **interceptor** in the API execution flow, providing opportunities to customize behavior **before** and **after** specific operations are processed. \n\n### Key Features & Purpose:\n1. **Interception Points**:  \n   - **Before Operation**: Executes logic prior to an API call (e.g., modifying inputs, validating data).  \n   - **After Operation**: Executes logic post-execution (e.g., logging results, triggering external systems).  \n\n2. **Use Cases**:  \n   - Modify API inputs/outputs during execution.  \n   - Trigger custom workflows or notifications.  \n   - Integrate with third-party systems seamlessly.  \n\n3. **Implementation Requirements**:  \n   - A Java class implementing the `IOperationListener` interface, which defines three methods:  \n     - `setup()`: Initializes the listener with configuration from `plugin.properties`.  \n     - `beforeOperation()`: Invoked before each API operation, providing access to the API context and session token.  \n     - `afterOperation()`: Invoked after the operation completes, with access to results or exceptions.  \n\n4. **Configuration**:  \n   - A `plugin.properties` file specifies the listener class and custom properties (e.g., `operation-listener.class`).  \n   - Example:  \n     ```properties\n     operation-listener.class = ch.ethz.sis.openbis.generic.server.asapi.v3.executor.operation.OperationListenerExample\n     operation-listener.your-config-property = Your Config Message\n     ```  \n\n5. **Critical Constraints**:  \n   - **Thread Safety**: The listener must be thread-safe since a single instance serves all API requests.  \n   - **No State Retention**: Avoid storing state between requests to prevent conflicts.  \n   - **Exception Handling**: Throwing exceptions in the listener will cause the API call to fail.  \n\nThis plugin is essential for extending openBIS functionality without modifying core APIs, enabling flexible integration with external systems or custom business logic.", "reference": "The V3 API listener core plugin is an implementation of the interceptor pattern:", "context_precision": NaN, "context_recall": 0.45, "faithfulness": NaN, "answer_relevancy": 0.9389656107320284, "idx": 95}

{"user_input": "What is Authorization in openBIS?", "retrieved_contexts": ["# AuthorizationAuthorization is a logic that decides whether a given user is allowed to perform a given operation on a given resource. In openBIS authorization decides if entities like spaces, projects, experiments, objects, datasets, can be created, read, updated or deleted by a given user.\n\nSimilar to other IT systems, openBIS access rights can be defined only for groups of resources rather than for each individual resource separately. In openBIS the purpose of such groups is served by spaces and projects. It means that an openBIS user can be given access to a specific space or a specific project (and all the entities that belong to that space or to that project) but cannot be given access just to a single experiment, object or dataset from that space or that project.\n\nApart from access to a space or a project, a user can be given openBIS instance access rights. With such rights a user can access any space and any project within that openBIS installation.", "## Overview\n\nAccess to openBIS is controlled at the *Space* level, *Project* level or openBIS instance level (see [openBIS roles](../general-admin-users/admins-documentation/user-registration.html#openbis-roles) ).", "# Authorization\n\nLast part of the openBIS authorization puzzle are users and user groups. So far we always assumed that a scope and a role will be directly assigned to a user, e.g. “John Doe” is an ADMIN of space “TEST”. Such an approach is absolutely fine and works great until the number of users we have to manage is relatively small. As the user base grows and so the maintenance overhead, it becomes handy to find users with the same access rights, put them into a user group and assign the rights to the user group rather than to each individual user. This way by simply assigning a user to a group we give him/her all the rights that are defined for that group. It leads to a simpler, more consistent and easier to maintain configuration.", "# Authorization\n\nWARNING: The project scope is disabled by default. To enable it for all users you have to change openBIS service.properties as follows:\n\n```\nauthorization.project-level.enabled = true\nauthorization.project-level.users = .*\n```\n\nThe “enabled” property controls whether the project scope can be used in general, while the “users” property defines exactly which users can use it. Setting “enabled” property to “true” will only make the project roles appear in “Roles” configuration tool in openBIS generic UI. These roles can be then assigned to users and saved. Still these roles won’t be used until a name of the user they are defined for matches the “users” regexp.", "# Authorization\n\nHaving defined the 3 scopes (i.e. instance, space and project), we need to learn how to control what operations a user can perform on entities that belong to these scopes.

These IDs determine which archive folder (e.g., `/net/miller/archive`) is used for storing related data. For example, the identifier `/MAIER/DEFAULT/EXP1` uses Share IDs `7` and `2`, which point to the archive folder `/net/miller/archive`.\n\n2. **Group-Specific Disk Allocation**:  \n   Each group in a facility instance is assigned a unique **share** (a symbolic link to an NFS directory) and one or more **Share IDs**. This ensures groups have dedicated disk space on the DSS store. For instance, the group `/SMITH` might use Share ID `6` to access its designated archive folder (`/net/smith/openbis/archive-big` or `/net/smith/openbis/archive-small` depending on data size).\n\n3. **Configuration and Permissions**:  \n   Share IDs are configured in the DSS store’s `shareIds` list and linked to specific NFS directories. This setup ensures that only authorized groups (via their Share IDs) can access their allocated storage, maintaining data isolation and security.\n\n4. **Handling Large Data Sets**:  \n   When a dataset is labeled as \"big,\" it is directed to a specific archive path (e.g., `/net/smith/openbis/archive-big`) using the corresponding Share ID, while smaller datasets use a different path. This allows efficient management of storage resources based on data size.\n\nIn summary, Share IDs act as a bridge between identifiers, archive folders, and group-specific storage, ensuring proper data organization and access control in facility instances.", "reference": "An openBIS instance for a facility often needs the possibility that each customer can have its one disk space in the data store.

PostgreSQL memory settings should be tuned using tools like [pgtune.leopard.in.ua](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) for optimal performance.\n\n### **Key Configuration Tasks**\n1. **Mail Server Setup**  \n   - Configure the `UsageReportingTask` to send weekly usage reports:  \n     ```properties\n     mail.from = openbis@<host>\n     mail.smtp.host = <SMTP host>\n     ```  \n   - Ensure the task runs nightly (e.g., at 1:15 AM) and sends reports to specified addresses.\n\n2. **LDAP Integration**  \n   - Set up LDAP for user management:  \n     ```properties\n     ldap.server.url = <LDAP server URL>\n     ldap.security.principal.distingished.name = <principal DN>\n     ldap.security.principal.password = <password>\n     ldap.searchBase = <search base DN>\n     ```  \n   - This enables centralized user authentication and synchronization.\n\n3. **Harvester Service**  \n   - Ensure the `HarvesterMaintenanceTask` is configured to sync master data, updating entities based on modification timestamps and using the `translate-using-data-source-alias` flag for namespace management.\n\n### **Best Practices**\n- Regularly monitor resource usage and adjust allocations as needed.  \n- Back up PostgreSQL configurations and ensure redundancy for critical services.  \n- Test LDAP and mail server configurations in a staging environment before deploying to production.  \n\nThis setup balances performance, scalability, and operational reliability for production environments.
