Spaces have no metadata apart from an ID and a free-text description. User access rights can be defined at the level of individual Spaces. A Project is a subfolder inside a Space that can contain one or more related Collections. Projects have no metadata apart from an ID and a free-text description. Just as for Spaces, user access rights can be defined at the level of individual Projects. A Collection is a container entity with its own user-defined metadata that groups Collection of the same or of different types. Collections types are defined as part of the openBIS masterdata and Collections of the same type are described by the same set of Properties. At a time, one Collection is part of exactly one Project. Objects are the core entitites of openBIS, they serve as the digital representation of physical or immaterial entities which are described by user-defined metadata. Object types are defined as part of the openBIS masterdata and Objects of the same type are described by the same set of Properties. At a time, one Object is part of a exactly one Collection but can be moved to another (or deleted altogether). It is possible to create directed links (parent-child relationships) between Objects. A Dataset in openBIS is container for different types of data (individual files of arbitrary formats as well as complex folder structures with subfolders and several files) which is described by user-defined metadata. Dataset types are defined as part of the openBIS masterdata and Datasets of the same type are described by the same set of Properties. Once created, the content (but not the metadata!) of a Dataset is immutable, i.e., the uploaded files cannot be edited or deleted after creation, nor can additional files be added. A Dataset has to be attached to either one Object or one Collection. It is possible to create directed links (parent-child relationships) between Datasets. Properties are user-defined metadata fields that are used to describe various openBIS entities (Collections, Objects, Datasets). Properties can be mandatory or optional. The same Property can be used in different entity types (e.g., the Property \"Name\"). openBIS offers the following data types for Properties: - Boolean: yes (1) or no (0) checkbox - Integer: integer number - Real: decimal number - Date: Date field (year, month, day) - Timestamp: date with timestamp (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) - String (Varchar): one-line text - Text field (Multiline Varchar): long text; possibly including a rich text editor - XML: XML field, e.g., to be used to include a spreadsheet component - Controlled Vocabulary: list of predefined values/terms - Object: 1-1 connection to a specific Object type.", "gold_docs": ["openBIS/Hierarchy.md"]}
