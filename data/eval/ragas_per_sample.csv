It serves as a logical grouping tool for organizing **Objects** (e.g., instruments, experimental steps, or protocols) within a **Project**.  

Key characteristics of a Collection:  
1. **User-Defined Properties**: Each Collection has custom properties tailored to its purpose, such as ""Measurement Devices"" or ""Default Experiment.""  
2. **Grouping Objects**: A Collection can hold an unlimited number of **Objects** of one or more types. For example, a ""Measurement Devices"" Collection might organize *Instrument* Objects, while a ""Default Experiment"" Collection might group *Experimental Step* Objects.  
3. **Dataset Association**: Collections can be linked to **Datasets**, which are folders for storing files. This allows data files to be tied to specific organizational contexts.  
4. **Masterdata-Driven**: Collection types are defined in the openBIS **masterdata**, ensuring consistency across similar Collections (e.g., all ""Inventory"" Collections share the same property structure).  

Collections are distinct from **Experiments** in the hierarchy but often work together, as Datasets can be attached to both. They are essential for structuring data in openBIS, enabling efficient categorization and management of lab materials, methods, and experimental workflows.","In openBIS, a Collection is a folder with user-defined Properties located on the third level of the hierarchical data structure (Space/Project/ Collection /Object).

### **1. Projects**
- **Delete directly** using the **Delete** option in the toolbar.  
- **Note**: Projects **cannot be deleted** if they contain any **Experiments**. First, delete all Experiments in the Project before attempting to delete the Project itself.  
- Projects are **permanently deleted** without being moved to a trashcan. Their deletion history is stored in the admin UI.

---

### **2. Experiments & Experimental Steps**
- **Delete via the toolbar**: Select the **Delete** option under the **More** tab.  
- **Trashcan**: Deleted items (Experiments and Steps) are moved to the **trashcan**.  
- **Permanent deletion**: To permanently delete them, navigate to the trashcan and remove the items.  
- **History**: Deleted entries are logged in the admin UI's ""History of deletions"" table.

---

### **3. Collections**
- **Step 1**: Go to the **Collection** page and select **Edit Collection** from the **More...** dropdown.  
- **Step 2**: Choose **Delete** from the **More...** dropdown to permanently delete the Collection.  
- **Note**: Collections are directly deleted without a trashcan step. Ensure all contained Objects and Datasets are handled before deletion.

---

### **4. Objects & Datasets**
- **Deletion process**: Objects and Datasets follow the same workflow as **Experiments**.  
  - Use the **Delete** option in the toolbar to move them to the trashcan.  
  - Permanently delete them by removing them from the trashcan.  
- **Archived Data Sets**: If archived, they can be permanently deleted using the **MultiDataSetDeletionMaintenanceTask** (configured in system settings).  

---

### Key Notes:
- **Trashcan behavior**: Experiments, Steps, and Datasets go to the trashcan; Projects and Collections are deleted directly.  
- **Admin access**: For permanent deletion, admin rights are required to access the ""History of deletions"" table.  
- **Parent-child relationships**: Moving or deleting Collections preserves Object/DataSet relationships.

### **Editing Projects**
1. Navigate to the **Materials** folder in the Inventory.
2. Click the **+ New Project** button to create a new project (for editing existing projects, this step may vary depending on the interface).
3. Enter the **Code** (this becomes the folder name) and optional description. Codes must be alphanumeric without spaces.

### **Editing Collections**
1. **To modify metadata or view details**:  
   - Go to the **Collection** page.  
   - Click **More.. > Edit Collection**.  
   - Update metadata or settings and click **Save**.  

2. **To move a Collection to a different Project**:  
   - Go to the **Collection** page.  
   - Click **More.. > Edit Collection**.  
   - Select **Move** from the dropdown.  
   - Enter the target **Project code** (openBIS will suggest options).  
   - Click **Accept** to complete the move.  

### **Editing Objects**
- **Direct editing via UI**: The context does not specify a standard ""Edit"" tab for Objects, but metadata can often be adjusted through the Object's details page.  
- **Batch updates**: Use the **XLS batch update tool** (available in the Inventory) to modify multiple Objects at once. This requires:  
  - Providing the full path to the **Project/Collection**.  
  - Including unique **Object identifiers** (these are globally unique in openBIS).

1. **Custom Barcodes/QR Codes**: After enabling, users can create unique barcodes/QR codes (e.g., for samples) that can be printed and physically attached to vials or labels. These custom codes can replace or complement the default barcode generated by openBIS, providing flexibility for lab workflows.  

2. **Batch Generation**: The functionality supports generating multiple barcodes/QR codes at once (e.g., for large batches of samples). This streamlines processes like labeling, tracking, and scanning, ensuring consistency and efficiency in data management.

   - **Export Metadata as XLSX**: Saves all metadata in a single **xlsx** folder, including a `metadata.xlsx` file. Note that fields like PermId or registration dates may not be import-compatible if this option is used alone.  
   - **Include Parents/Children**: Select options to include related entities (e.g., parents or children from the same space or different spaces).  
   - **Receive Results by Email**: Configure this system-wide to get a download link via email once the export is ready.  

3. **Export to File or Research Collection**:  
   - For standard exports, the result is a ZIP file containing folders like **scripts**, **data**, **miscellaneous**, or **hierarchy**, depending on your settings.  
   - For ETH Research Collection exports, the data is saved as a ZIP file with metadata in multiple formats (.txt, .html, .doc, .json) and the original hierarchy preserved. The size limit for this export is 10GB.

   - **Advanced filters**: If available, apply filters by selecting criteria such as object type, status, or other attributes.
3. **Leverage Saved Searches**: If you’ve saved search queries previously, you can reuse them to quickly filter objects.

Here’s how it works:  

1. **Grant Access via Manage Access**:  
   - Navigate to a Space or Project.  
   - Click the **More** dropdown menu and select **Manage Access**.  
   - Choose a role for the user or group:  
     - **Observer**: Read-only access (cannot edit or delete).  
     - **User**: Can create, modify, and delete entities (e.g., datasets, objects).  
     - **Admin**: Full control, including managing roles and permissions for the Space/Project.  

2. **Assign Roles to Users or Groups**:  
   - Enter a **username** (for individual users) or a **group name** (for existing user groups).  
   - Roles can also be assigned at the **Space/Project level** or **instance level** for broader access.  

3. **Administrative Roles for Advanced Control**:  
   - **Space/Project Power User**: Can create, edit, and delete entities within a Space/Project.  
   - **Space/Project Admin**: Manages roles and permissions for the Space/Project.  
   - **Instance Admin**: Full administrative access to the entire openBIS instance.  

4. **Group-Based Access Management**:  
   - For user groups (e.g., LDAP groups), you can create **common spaces** and assign roles to groups, ensuring consistent access across multiple users.  
   - Personal user spaces are automatically created for individual users with **SPACE_ADMIN** rights by default, unless disabled.

### **What Are Parents and Children?**  
- **Parents** are objects (e.g., samples, protocols, equipment, or other Experimental Steps) that are used, referenced, or directly involved in the experimental procedure. For example:  
  - A sample used in the step (parent).  
  - A protocol from the inventory followed during the step (parent).  
  - A prior Experimental Step that this step depends on (parent).  
- **Children** are objects that depend on or are derived from the parent. For instance, a derived sample from a parent sample or a subsequent Experimental Step linked to a prior one.  

### **How to Define Them**  
1. **Edit the Experimental Step Object**:  
   - Open the Experimental Step in the openBIS interface.  
   - Navigate to the **Parents** and **Children** sections (customizable by lab managers).  
2. **Search and Link Objects**:  
   - Use the search tool to find relevant objects (e.g., materials, protocols, equipment, or other steps).  
   - Select the object type (e.g., ""Sample,"" ""Protocol"") and enter its code or name.  
3. **Save Relationships**:  
   - Review the linked entries and save your changes to establish the parent-child connection.  

### **Key Notes**  
- **Customization**: Lab managers can tailor which objects appear in the Parents/Children sections.  
- **Examples**:  
  - A step using a specific sample as input (parent) and producing a derived sample (child).  
  - A step following a protocol (parent) and generating experimental data (child).  
  - Sequential steps where one step is a child of another (e.g., ""Step B"" is a child of ""Step A"").

How should research data be conceptually modeled and represented?,"['# Conceptual data Model To map research data in the Data Store – openBIS Research Data Management system, data are stored together with all experimental steps, tangible and intangible objects (things you do, generate and have) that are relevant to generate traceable and reusable data.

1. **Define the Workflow**:  
   - Identify all data types (files, datasets) and experimental steps (e.g., synthesis, measurements, analysis) involved in your research.  
   - Map these steps in a logical sequence using unidirectional arrows to show dependencies. Attach datasets to experimental steps to trace their origin.  

2. **Visualize Relationships**:  
   - Use a tool like **Draw.io** (or any visualization tool) to create a diagram.  
   - Highlight **tangible** objects (e.g., samples, materials) and **intangible** objects (e.g., chemicals, equipment) with general categories (e.g., ""Chemicals"") to simplify the model.  
   - Define **parent-child relationships** between objects and steps to reflect how data is generated and connected.  

3. **Leverage Templates**:  
   - If a predefined template exists (e.g., for your group or project), use it to populate forms for experimental steps. This streamlines data entry and ensures consistency.  

4. **Organize Data Structure**:  
   - Structure data in folders within the Data Store, aligning with the workflow diagram. Ensure each experimental step has at least one dataset attached to maintain traceability.  

5. **Manage Roles and Access**:  
   - Configure roles and permissions at the **Space** and **Project** levels to align with research agreements or collaborations.  

6. **Register and Connect Data**:  
   - Register projects, collections, and objects (e.g., experimental steps, materials) in openBIS. Link related steps (e.g., ""EuVSOP Synthesis"" to ""EuVSOP HEE Treatment"") to reflect logical dependencies.  

7. **Document and Iterate**:  
   - Regularly review and refine the model with your team to adapt to evolving research needs. This ensures the model remains practical for data management, analysis, and collaboration.  

By following these steps, you create a clear, reusable framework that supports traceable, reproducible research while aligning with openBIS and the Data Store’s capabilities.","To map research data in the Data Store  openBIS Research Data Management system, data are stored together with all experimental steps, tangible and intangible objects (things you do, generate and have) that are relevant to generate traceable and reusable data.

Here’s how they help:  

1. **Unique Identification**: When an object (e.g., a sample) is registered in openBIS, a default barcode is automatically generated. This acts as a unique identifier, making it easy to link physical items to their digital records.  

2. **Quick Access to Information**: Scanning a barcode or QR code displays the object’s details, such as its name, location, or associated experiment. This saves time and reduces errors during data entry or experimentation.  

3. **Linking to Experiments**: During experiments, scanning a sample’s barcode automatically connects it to the experiment record in openBIS. This ensures accurate tracking of which samples are used in which experiments.  

4. **Flexibility in Labeling**: Barcodes can be pre-assigned (e.g., for batch imports) or generated dynamically (e.g., using PermId). This flexibility accommodates both small-scale and large-scale workflows.  

5. **Physical Labeling**: Barcodes are printed on durable stickers and applied to physical objects. This makes it easy to locate and manage items in lab environments, even when they’re stored in containers or cabinets.  

In short, barcodes and QR codes in openBIS bridge the gap between physical objects and digital data, ensuring seamless integration, accuracy, and efficiency in lab workflows. 🧪📊","To enable fast and secure referencing of physical objects (e.g., samples, instruments) in openBIS using barcodes or QR codes.",0.8041666666465626,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8428413405228781,58

Here’s a structured overview:  

1. **Keep Masterdata Generic and Specific as Needed**  
   Define Masterdata to be as generic as possible while meeting specific requirements. Avoid division-specific codes (e.g., `BAM_FBX.Y_ROOM_TEMPERATURE`) to ensure reusability across projects.  

2. **Reuse Existing Definitions**  
   Prioritize reusing established entity types (e.g., *Collection*, *Object*, *Dataset*) and controlled vocabularies from other groups. This reduces duplication and ensures alignment with broader standards.  

3. **Use Excel Templates for Organization**  
   Each entity type (except *Property* types) and controlled vocabulary should be defined in separate Excel files. Include all dependencies (e.g., new vocabularies, scripts) in these files for clarity and ease of review.  

4. **Validate with the Masterdata Checker**  
   Use the [Masterdata Checker tool](https://mdc.datastore.bam.de/) to verify your definitions before sharing them. This ensures compliance with rules and identifies potential issues.  

5. **Follow Naming and Structure Guidelines**  
   - Avoid division-specific prefixes in codes or labels.  
   - Ensure consistency between Excel files and referenced vocabularies (e.g., codes in object type files must match those in controlled vocabulary files).  

6. **Collaborate with Instance Admins**  
   While Data Store Stewards (DSSt) can draft Masterdata using templates, instance admins are required to register it in openBIS. Share your work via GitHub repositories or email (datastore@bam.de) for review.  

By adhering to these practices, you ensure Masterdata remains scalable, maintainable, and aligned with the BAM Data Store’s goals.

1. **Register Masterdata in the Training Instance**: Use the Admin UI of the `training` Data Store instance to create Masterdata (e.g., Object Types or Controlled Vocabularies). This requires instance admin rights, which DSSt have access to.  

2. **Export to Excel**:  
   - Navigate to **Object Types** or **Vocabulary Types** in the Admin UI.  
   - Select the entity type(s) you want to export.  
   - Go to the **EXPORTS** tab and ensure ""Import Compatible: Yes"" is selected.  
   - If the entity type has new dependencies (e.g., controlled vocabularies or validation scripts not in the `main` instance), check ""Include dependencies: Yes"".  
   - Export the data as an Excel file, ensuring ""Columns: All (default order)"" is selected to preserve formatting for import.  

3. **Prepare for Import**:  
   - Rename the exported files according to the naming conventions.  
   - Reorganize files if needed, ensuring each entity type (except *Property* types) and controlled vocabulary are in separate files.  
   - Verify consistency between files and vocabulary codes.  

4. **Upload to GitHub**:  
   - Share the organized Excel files via a GitHub repository.  
   - Ensure files comply with [Masterdata best practices](/en/masterdata_definition/best_practices) and use the [Masterdata checker](https://mdc.datastore.bam.de/) to validate them before submission.  

5. **Import into Main Instance**:

What are the components of the openBIS Data Structure Hierarchy?,"['# Data Structure Hierarchy ## User Interface (UI) Structure ### Lab Notebook ### Inventory ## Folders ### Space A Space is a folder at the top of the openBIS data structure hierarchy that can contain one or more related [Projects](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#project). Spaces have no metadata apart from an ID and a free-text description. User access rights can be defined at the level of individual Spaces. ### Project A Project is a subfolder inside a [Space](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#space) that can contain one or more related [Collections](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#collection). Projects have no metadata apart from an ID and a free-text description. Just as for [Spaces](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#space), user access rights can be defined at the level of individual Projects. ## Entities ### Collection A Collection is a container entity with its own user-defined metadata that groups [Collection](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#collection) of the same or of different types. Collections types are defined as part of the openBIS masterdata and Collections of the same type are described by the same set of [Properties](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#property). At a time, one Collection is part of exactly one [Project](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#projects). ### Object Objects are the core entitites of openBIS, they serve as the digital representation of physical or immaterial entities which are described by user-defined metadata. Object types are defined as part of the openBIS masterdata and Objects of the same type are described by the same set of [Properties](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#property). At a time, one Object is part of a exactly one [Collection](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#collection) but can be moved to another (or deleted altogether). It is possible to create directed links (parent-child relationships) between Objects. ### Dataset A Dataset in openBIS is container for different types of data (individual files of arbitrary formats as well as complex folder structures with subfolders and several files) which is described by user-defined metadata. Dataset types are defined as part of the openBIS masterdata and Datasets of the same type are described by the same set of [Properties](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#property). Once created, the content (but not the metadata!) of a Dataset is immutable, i.e., the uploaded files cannot be edited or deleted after creation, nor can additional files be added. A Dataset has to be attached to either one [Object](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#object) or one [Collection](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#collection). It is possible to create directed links (parent-child relationships) between Datasets. ### Property Properties are user-defined metadata fields that are used to describe various openBIS entities ([Collections](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#collection), [Objects](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#Object), [Datasets](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#dataset)). Properties can be mandatory or optional. The same Property can be used in different entity types (e.g., the Property ""Name""). openBIS offers the following data types for Properties: - Boolean: yes (1) or no (0) checkbox - Integer: integer number - Real: decimal number - Date: Date field (year, month, day) - Timestamp: date with timestamp (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) - String (Varchar): one-line text - Text field (Multiline Varchar): long text; possibly including a rich text editor - XML: XML field, e.g., to be used to include a spreadsheet component - Controlled [Vocabulary](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#vocabulary): list of predefined values/terms - Object: 1-1 connection to a specific [Object](/de/openBIS/Hierarchy#object) type.', '## Preamble[openBIS](https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/bis/Home) is a research data management system developed by [ETH SIS](https://sis.id.ethz.ch/).

Here's a breakdown of the core components:

1. **Space**:  
   The top-level container in the hierarchy. A Space can contain multiple Projects and serves as a logical grouping for related research activities. Spaces have minimal metadata (an ID and description) but allow granular access control.

2. **Project**:  
   A subfolder within a Space, used to organize related Collections. Projects also have minimal metadata (an ID and description) and support access control at the project level.

3. **Collection**:  
   A container entity with user-defined metadata that groups items (e.g., Objects or Datasets). Collections are tied to a specific Project and can have properties to describe their contents.

4. **Object**:  
   The core entity representing physical or immaterial entities (e.g., samples, instruments). Objects have user-defined properties and can belong to a Space, Project, Collection, or exist independently (shared across Spaces). They can also have links to other Objects.

5. **Dataset**:  
   A folder-like structure for storing files or complex data structures. Datasets are linked to either an Object or a Collection and have user-defined properties. Once created, the content of a Dataset is immutable (files cannot be edited or added), though metadata can be updated.

6. **Property**:  
   User-defined metadata fields that describe entities like Collections, Objects, or Datasets. Properties can be mandatory or optional and support various data types (e.g., text, numbers, dates, or controlled vocabularies).

### Relationships and Access Control  
- **Access Rights**: Controlled at the Space, Project, or instance level, determining who can view or edit data.  
- **Hierarchical Nesting**: Spaces → Projects → Collections → Objects/Datasets. Objects can also exist independently of Spaces or Projects.  
- **Links**: Directed relationships (parent-child) between Objects and Datasets allow for flexible data organization.  

This structure enables efficient data management, collaboration, and metadata-driven organization tailored to research workflows.

Moreover, before calling any of the API methods\nyou have to login to the system to receive a sessionToken. All the login\nmethods are part of the AS API. Once you successfully authenticate in\nopenBIS you can invoke other methods of the API (at both AS and DSS). In\neach call you have to provide your sessionToken. When you have finished\nworking with the API you should call logout method to release all the\nresources related with your session.\n\nNote: If the openBIS instance you are connecting to uses SSL and does\nnot have a real certificate (it is using the self-signed certificate\nthat comes with openBIS), you need to tell the java client to use the\ntrust store that comes with openBIS.

     - `IDatastoreServerAPI` (manages data store operations such as dataset file searches and downloads).  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Synchronous transaction-based methods for CRUD operations, archiving, and custom service execution.

2. **JavaScript API**  
   - A client-side module hosted at `<OPENBIS_URL>/resources/api/v3/openbis.js` (e.g., `http://localhost/openbis/resources/api/v3/openbis.js`).  
   - Simplifies integration for web applications, leveraging the same backend capabilities as the Java API.

What are Personal Access Tokens (PAT) in openBIS?,"['## Who can create a “Personal access token” ?Any openBIS user can manage its own PATs. Instance admin users can\nmanage all PATs in the system.', '## What are “Personal access tokens” ?A personal access token (in short: PAT) is very similar to a session\ntoken but there are also some important differences.\n\nSimilarities:\n\n* a PAT is bound to a specific user and represents that user’s\n  session. Two users can’t share a session using PAT. Internal PAT\n  sessions identifier is the combination of both the userId and the\n  session name.\n* a PAT is a secret that must not be publicly shared (having a user’s\n  PAT one can perform any actions in openBIS that this user could\n  normally perform, except for user and PAT management)\n* a user can have multiple PATs active at the same time\n* a PAT can be used in places where a regular session token could be\n  normally used, e.g. to call V3 API methods (a full list of endpoints\n  that support PATs is presented below)\n\nDifferences:', '## connect to OpenBIS\n\n### Personal access token (PAT)\n\nIf there is an existing PAT with the same *sessionName* which is still valid and the validity is within the warning period (defined by the server), then this existing PAT is returned instead. However, you can enforce creating a new PAT by passing the argument `force=True`.\n\nNote\n\nMost operations are permitted using the PAT, *except*:\n\n* all operations on personal access tokens itself\n* i.e. create, list, delete operations on tokens\n\nFor these operations, you need to use a session token instead.\n\nTo get a list of all currently available tokens:\n\n```\no.get_personal_access_tokens()\no.get_personal_access_tokens(sessionName=""APPLICATION_1"")\n```\n\nTo delete the first token shown in the list:\n\n```\no.get_personal_access_tokens()[0].delete(\'some reason\')\n```', '## What are “Personal access tokens” ?\n\n* a PAT is created using a dedicated “createPersonalAccessTokens” V3\n  API method (not using “login” method as a regular session token)\n* a PAT can be long lived (its validFrom and validTo dates are defined\n  at the moment of creation), still it should be replaced periodically\n  for security reasons\n* a PAT session survives openBIS restarts, i.e. the same PAT can be\n  used before and after a restart (session workspace folder state is\n  also kept)\n* multiple PATs may represent a single PAT session (both PATs must\n  have the same “session name”) - this becomes useful for handling a\n  transition period from one soon to be expired PAT to a new PAT that\n  replaces it without losing the session’s state', '## Background“Personal access token” (in short: PAT) is an openBIS feature that was\nintroduced to simplify integration of openBIS with other systems. Such\nintegrations are usually done using openBIS V3 API and therefore require\nan external application to authenticate in openBIS to fetch or create\nsome data. Without “Personal access tokens” the only way of\nauthenticating in openBIS V3 API was the V3 API login method. Given a\nuser name and a password the login method would return back an openBIS\nsession token, which could be later used in other V3 API calls as a\nsecret and a proof of who we are.\n\nUnfortunately, even though this approach worked well it had some\nlimitations. These were mainly caused by the nature of session tokens in\nopenBIS:\n\n* session tokens are short lived\n* session tokens do not survive openBIS restarts\n* obtaining a new session token requires a user name and a password']","Personal Access Tokens (PATs) in openBIS are a secure way to authenticate and interact with the system, especially for integrations with external tools or automation. Here’s a clear breakdown:

### **Key Features of PATs**
1. **User-Specific & Long-Lived**  
   - PATs are tied to a specific user and can be long-lived (their validity dates are set at creation). However, they should be rotated periodically for security.

2. **Survive System Restarts**  
   - Unlike session tokens, PATs persist even after openBIS restarts, ensuring uninterrupted access to data and workflows.

3. **No Password Required**  
   - PATs eliminate the need to handle user passwords for API interactions. They are generated via the `createPersonalAccessTokens` API method, not through the standard login process.

4. **Session Management**  
   - Multiple PATs can represent the same session (with the same ""session name""), enabling seamless transitions when replacing an expiring token without losing state.

5. **Scoped Permissions**  
   - PATs grant access to the same actions as a user’s session token, **except** for operations involving managing tokens themselves (e.g., creating, listing, or deleting PATs). These actions require a session token instead.

### **Use Cases**
- **Automated Workflows**: PATs are ideal for scripts or tools that need to interact with openBIS without manual intervention.  
- **External Integrations**: They simplify secure communication between openBIS and third-party systems via the V3 API.  
- **Multi-Session Handling**: Multiple PATs with the same session name allow for smooth transitions during token renewal.

### **Limitations**
- **No Password Sharing**: While PATs avoid password exposure, they must remain confidential (sharing a PAT is equivalent to sharing a user’s credentials).  
- **No Self-Management**: You cannot use a PAT to create, list, or delete other PATs. These actions require a session token.

In short, PATs are a flexible, secure, and user-friendly alternative to session tokens for automation and integration, while still adhering to openBIS’s security model.

3. **View Configuration**: Through JSON structures in `plugin.js`, extensions modify how data is displayed, such as associating file types (e.g., `.csv`, `.txt`) with specific dataset types for easier file management.  
4. **Technology-Specific Enhancements**: Extensions like ""Life Sciences"" or ""Microscopy"" add domain-specific tools, enabling specialized workflows for research areas.

What are openBIS webapps and how are they distributed?,"['## Embedding webapps in the OpenBIS UI\n\n### IntroductionWebapps can be used as both standalone applications as well as can be\nembedded in the OpenBIS web UI. Standalone webapps are built to\ncompletely replace the original OpenBIS web interface with customer\nadjusted layout and functionality. Users of the standalone webapps are\nusually completely unaware of the default OpenBIS look and feel. The\nwebapp itself provides them with all the functionality they need: login\npages, web forms, searches, images, charts etc. The standalone webapp is\na right choice when you want to build a very specific and fully featured\nweb interface from scratch. If you want to use the default OpenBIS UI\nbut extend it with some custom functionality then embedding a webapp in\nthe OpenBIS UI is probably a way to go. To make a webapp visible as a\npart of the default OpenBIS UI you have to define where the webapp\nshould be shown using “openbisui-contexts” property. Moreover some of\nthe contexts also require additional information describing when the\nwebapp should be shown. For instance, to embed a webapp in the\nexperiment details view that will be displayed for experiments with type\n“MY\\_EXPERIMENT\\_TYPE” your plugin.properties file should look like:', '## Embedding webapps in the OpenBIS UI\n\n### Introduction\n\n**plugin.propeties**\n\n```\nwebapp-folder = html\nopenbisui-contexts = experiment-details-view\nexperiment-entity-types = MY_EXPERIMENT_TYPE\n```\n\n\n\n### Configuring embedded webappsA full list of supported properties is presented below.', '## Embedding webapps in the OpenBIS UI\n\n### Creating embedded webappsEmbedded webapps similar to the standalone counterparts are HTML5\napplications that interact with OpenBIS. Because embedded webapps are\nshown inside the OpenBIS UI they have access to additional information\nabout the context they are displayed in. For instance, a webapp that is\ndisplayed in the experiment-details-view context knows that it is\ndisplayed for an experiment entity, with a given type, identifier and\npermid. Having this information the webapp can adjust itself and display\nonly data related to the currently chosen entity. Apart from the entity\ndetails, a webapp also receives a current sessionId that can be used for\ncalling OpenBIS JSON RPC services. This way embedded webapps can reuse a\ncurrent session that was created when a user logged in to the OpenBIS\nrather than provide their own login pages for authentication. A sample\nwebapp that makes use of this context information is presented below:', '## Repository organizationThe repository contains these kind of modules used to build the openBIS distributable:\n\n* api-\\*: API Facades\n* app-\\*: Applications\n* build: Build scripts\n* core-plugins-\\*: Core plugins distributed with openBIS\n* lib-\\*: Internally maintained libraries used to build openBIS\n* server-\\*: Server components\n* test-\\*: Integration tests\n* ui-\\*: User interfaces', '## Embedding webapps in the OpenBIS UI\n\n### Creating embedded webapps\n\n// reuse the current sessionId that we received in the context for all the facade calls\no.useSession(c.getSessionId());\n\n    // call one of the OpenBIS facade methods\n    o.listProjects(function(response){\n        $(""#log"").append(""<br/>Projects:<br/>""); \n        $.each(response.result, function(index, value){\n                $(""#log"").append(value.code + ""<br/>"");  \n        });\n    });\n});\n\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n\n### Linking to subtabs of other entity detail viewsA link from a webapp to an entity subtab looks like this:\n\n```\n<a href=""#"" onclick=""window.top.location.hash=\'#entity=[ENTITY_KIND]&permId=[PERM_ID]&ui-subtab=[SECTION];return false;"">Link Text</a>\n```\n\n, for example\n\n```\n<a href=""#"" onclick=""window.top.location.hash=\'#entity=EXPERIMENT&permId=20140716095938913-1&ui-subtab=webapp-section_test-webapp;return false;"">Experiment webapp</a>\n```']","openBIS webapps are customizable web applications that can either replace the default OpenBIS interface (as standalone apps) or be embedded within the OpenBIS UI to extend its functionality. They are built using HTML5 and interact with OpenBIS through its JSON RPC services. 

**Distribution**  
Webapps are distributed as part of the OpenBIS project’s repository structure. Specifically:  
- They are organized under the `ui-*` modules, which handle user interfaces.  
- For embedded webapps, developers define their integration via a `plugin.properties` file, specifying contexts (e.g., `experiment-details-view`) and entity types (e.g., `MY_EXPERIMENT_TYPE`). This configuration determines where and when the webapp appears within the OpenBIS UI.  

This approach allows webapps to reuse the existing OpenBIS session for authentication and access entity-specific data dynamically.","Webapps are HTML5 apps that interact with openBIS. Webapps can be distributed as core-plugins. To supply a webapp plugin, create a folder called webapps in the as . Each subfolder of the webapps folder is treated as a webapp plugin.

Here’s why it matters:

1. **Database Configuration**: The guide outlines mandatory database settings (e.g., `database.` properties) that must be correctly configured to ensure openBIS can connect to and manage its data storage. Incorrect settings here would prevent the system from functioning.

2. **Server-Specific Setup**:  
   - The **Application Server** relies on `$INSTALL_PATH/servers/openBIS-server/jetty/etc/service.properties` for core settings, while the **Data Store Server** uses its own `$INSTALL_PATH/servers/datastore_server/etc/service.properties` file. These files define critical parameters like data paths, security settings, and resource allocation.  
   - Custom configurations (e.g., modified `jetty.xml`) require specific adjustments, such as replacing `WebAppProvider` with `OpenbisWebAppProvider` to ensure webapps are injected correctly. Missing these steps could disrupt service availability.

3. **Data Source Integration**: The guide emphasizes aligning configuration overrides with `AS service.properties` keys to avoid conflicts. For example, `request-handler.file-service-repository-path` must point to the correct `file-server` location, ensuring seamless data access.

It acts as a bridge between openBIS and external tools like BLAST, allowing users to search for matches in local sequence databases. 

For example, when you use a search domain service, it leverages tools like BLAST to find sequences that match a given string. The results include details like the **description** of the sequence, its **location** within openBIS (e.g., a dataset file or an entity property), and a **score** indicating the relevance of the match. Results are sorted by score in descending order to prioritize the most relevant hits.

To use it, you interact with the `IGeneralInformationService` interface, which provides methods like `listAvailableSearchDomains` (to see available services) and `searchOnSearchDomain` (to perform searches). Configuring such a service requires setting up a core-plugin with a specific Java class implementation and metadata like a label for user interfaces.

Once that was done, we could start loading all the necessary V3 API\nclasses and the V3 API facade to make our V3 API calls.\n\nThis approach worked fine, but there were also some drawbacks:\n\n* each V3 API class we wanted to use had to be explicitly “required” and its full class name had to be provided (e.g. as/dto/space/Space)\n* classes were loaded asynchronously making the code using the V3 API more complex\n* every V3 API class was loaded with a separate HTTP request to the server (loading multiple classes resulted in multiple requests to the server)\n* it required a third party dependency manager (here RequireJS)']","The **V3 API Listener Core Plugin** is a server-side extension for the openBIS system that allows integrators to intercept and modify API operations dynamically. It acts as an **interceptor** in the API execution flow, providing opportunities to customize behavior **before** and **after** specific operations are processed. 

### Key Features & Purpose:
1. **Interception Points**:  
   - **Before Operation**: Executes logic prior to an API call (e.g., modifying inputs, validating data).  
   - **After Operation**: Executes logic post-execution (e.g., logging results, triggering external systems).  

2. **Use Cases**:  
   - Modify API inputs/outputs during execution.  
   - Trigger custom workflows or notifications.  
   - Integrate with third-party systems seamlessly.  

3. **Implementation Requirements**:  
   - A Java class implementing the `IOperationListener` interface, which defines three methods:  
     - `setup()`: Initializes the listener with configuration from `plugin.properties`.  
     - `beforeOperation()`: Invoked before each API operation, providing access to the API context and session token.  
     - `afterOperation()`: Invoked after the operation completes, with access to results or exceptions.  

4. **Configuration**:  
   - A `plugin.properties` file specifies the listener class and custom properties (e.g., `operation-listener.class`).  
   - Example:  
     ```properties
     operation-listener.class = ch.ethz.sis.openbis.generic.server.asapi.v3.executor.operation.OperationListenerExample
     operation-listener.your-config-property = Your Config Message
     ```  

5. **Critical Constraints**:  
   - **Thread Safety**: The listener must be thread-safe since a single instance serves all API requests.  
   - **No State Retention**: Avoid storing state between requests to prevent conflicts.  
   - **Exception Handling**: Throwing exceptions in the listener will cause the API call to fail.

What are Custom Application Server Services?,"['## How to use a custom AS serviceThe application API version 3 offers the following method to search for existing services:\n\n```\nSearchResult<CustomASService> searchCustomASServices(String sessionToken, CustomASServiceSearchCriteria searchCriteria, CustomASServiceFetchOptions fetchOptions)\n```\n\nThe following Java code example returns all available services:\n\n```\nSearchResult<CustomASService> services = service.searchCustomASServices(sessionToken, new CustomASServiceSearchCriteria(), new CustomASServiceFetchOptions());\n```\n\nWith the following method of the API version 3 a specified service can\nbe executed:\n\n```\npublic Object executeCustomASService(String sessionToken, ICustomASServiceId serviceId, CustomASServiceExecutionOptions options);\n```', '## IntroductionOn Data Store Server (DSS) aggregation/ingestion services based on Jython scripts can be used to extend openBIS by custom services. These services have full access on data store and Application Server (AS).\n\nOften only access on AS is needed. Going over DSS is a detour. For such cases it is better to write an AS core plugin of type `services`.', '## How to use a custom AS service\n\nThe `serviceId` can be obtained from a `CustomASService` object (as returned by the `searchCustomASServices` method) by the getter method `getCode()`. It can also be created as an instance of `CustomASServiceCode`. Note, that the service code is just the core plugin name.\n\nParameter bindings (i.e. key-value pairs) are specified in the `CustomASServiceExecutionOptions` object by invoking for each binding the method `withParameter()`.\n\nHere is a code example:\n\n```\nCustomASServiceExecutionOptions options = new CustomASServiceExecutionOptions().withParameter(""space_code"", ""my-space"");\nObject result = service.executeCustomASService(sessionToken, new CustomASServiceCode(""space-creator""), options);\nSystem.out.println(result);\n```', '## Application Server Configuration\n\n### Database Settings\n\nAdditional configuration options are outlined [here](optional-application-server-configuration.html).', '## IV.

These services can be implemented in two ways:  
1. **As Jython scripts on the Data Store Server (DSS)**: They handle tasks related to data aggregation or ingestion, with full access to the data store and Application Server.  
2. **As AS core plugins**: For simpler tasks requiring only AS access (without needing to interact with DSS), you can create a plugin of type `services`.  

To use a custom AS service:  
- First, search for available services using `searchCustomASServices()` to get their unique `serviceId` (code).  
- Then, execute the service with `executeCustomASService()` by providing parameters via `CustomASServiceExecutionOptions`.  

**Example**:  
```java
CustomASServiceExecutionOptions options = new CustomASServiceExecutionOptions().withParameter(""space_code"", ""my-space"");
Object result = service.executeCustomASService(sessionToken, new CustomASServiceCode(""space-creator""), options);
```  
This would run the ""space-creator"" service with the parameter `space_code=my-space`, returning the result.

What is the purpose of Core Plugins in openBIS?,"['## Core PluginsIt is possible to make adjustments to core-plugins shipped with the openBIS installer. To do so, just start up openBIS at least once.

They are part of the openBIS distribution and stored in the `core-plugins` directory, which is unpacked alongside other critical folders like `openBIS-server` and `datastore_server`. These plugins handle critical tasks such as:

1. **Initialization and Configuration**: Scripts like `initialize-master-data.py` register master data in the core database, ensuring foundational data is properly set up.
2. **Customization**: Plugins like `eln-lims` allow adjustments to behavior (e.g., enabling semantic annotations via `InstanceProfile.js`) through configuration files or code modifications.
3. **System Integration**: Directories like `dss-data-sources` and `query-databases` define data sources and SQL queries, enabling integration with external systems or custom data processing.
4. **Maintenance and Services**: Plugins in `maintenance-tasks` or `services` manage scheduled tasks or custom application services, enhancing operational flexibility.

Here's how they work:

1. **Functionality**:  
   A Jython Dropbox enables scripts to monitor a directory (the ""dropbox"") for incoming files. When files arrive, the script can process them, register them as data sets, samples, or experiments, and link them to specific projects, spaces, or experiments (e.g., attaching files to the ""JYTHON"" experiment in the ""TESTPROJ"" project).

2. **Robustness**:  
   The system ensures data integrity by tracking file operations. If an error occurs during registration, it automatically reverts changes to return files to their original state.

3. **Python Flexibility**:  
   By default, Python 2.5 is used, but you can configure it to use Python 2.7. Scripts can leverage Jython libraries and third-party JARs (placed in a `lib/` subfolder of the core plugin).

4. **Configuration**:  
   - Dropboxes are distributed as core plugins and configured via `plugin.properties`, specifying the incoming directory (e.g., `${root-dir}/incoming-jython`) and the script name (no full path needed if the script is in the same directory).  
   - The `datastore_server.conf` file must include the Python path (e.g., `-Dpython.path=data/dropboxes/scripts:lib/jython-lib`) to access additional modules.

5. **Error Handling**:  
   For debugging, key files and folders (like logs or temporary storage) help identify issues. The `rollback_pre_registration` function handles cases where data registration fails after successful script execution.

**Version 20.10.10** introduced a modification to the Datastore logs configuration. Specifically:  
- **The ability to configure the log file location for the Datastore was removed**. Previously, this setting might have been available in the configuration, but it is no longer supported in this version.  

This change is part of the **pending configuration changes** documented in the release notes. The removal of this configuration option simplifies the logging setup but may require adjustments to logging management workflows if previously relied on custom log file paths.

### **1. Manual Archiving via the UI**  
- **Single Dataset**: Navigate to the dataset in the ELN (Electronic Lab Notebook), and click the **""Request or disallow archiving""** button. This initiates the archiving process for that specific dataset.  
- **Multiple Datasets**: Use the **Archiving Helper tool** under the **Utilities** menu. Here, you can search for datasets (e.g., by size) and select multiple datasets to archive. Click **""Request Archiving""** to bundle and archive them together.  

### **2. Programmatic Archiving via the API**  
For developers, the V3 API allows archiving datasets using the `DataSetArchiveOptions` class. By setting the `removeFromDataStore` flag (default: `true` for moving datasets to the archive), you can trigger archiving programmatically.  

### **Key Notes**  
- Archiving status changes to **BACKUP_PENDING** or **ARCHIVE_PENDING** until the process completes.  
- If datasets are below the **10GB minimum size threshold**, they are queued and archived together with others in the same project/experiment when the size requirement is met.  
- To unarchive, repeat the process and select **""Unarchive""** instead.

What is Authorization in openBIS?,"['# AuthorizationAuthorization is a logic that decides whether a given user is allowed to perform a given operation on a given resource. In openBIS authorization decides if entities like spaces, projects, experiments, objects, datasets, can be created, read, updated or deleted by a given user.\n\nSimilar to other IT systems, openBIS access rights can be defined only for groups of resources rather than for each individual resource separately. In openBIS the purpose of such groups is served by spaces and projects. It means that an openBIS user can be given access to a specific space or a specific project (and all the entities that belong to that space or to that project) but cannot be given access just to a single experiment, object or dataset from that space or that project.\n\nApart from access to a space or a project, a user can be given openBIS instance access rights. With such rights a user can access any space and any project within that openBIS installation.', '## Overview\n\nAccess to openBIS is controlled at the *Space* level, *Project* level or openBIS instance level (see [openBIS roles](../general-admin-users/admins-documentation/user-registration.html#openbis-roles) ).', '# Authorization\n\nLast part of the openBIS authorization puzzle are users and user groups. So far we always assumed that a scope and a role will be directly assigned to a user, e.g. “John Doe” is an ADMIN of space “TEST”. Such an approach is absolutely fine and works great until the number of users we have to manage is relatively small. As the user base grows and so the maintenance overhead, it becomes handy to find users with the same access rights, put them into a user group and assign the rights to the user group rather than to each individual user. This way by simply assigning a user to a group we give him/her all the rights that are defined for that group. It leads to a simpler, more consistent and easier to maintain configuration.', '# Authorization\n\nWARNING: The project scope is disabled by default. To enable it for all users you have to change openBIS service.properties as follows:\n\n```\nauthorization.project-level.enabled = true\nauthorization.project-level.users = .*\n```\n\nThe “enabled” property controls whether the project scope can be used in general, while the “users” property defines exactly which users can use it. Setting “enabled” property to “true” will only make the project roles appear in “Roles” configuration tool in openBIS generic UI. These roles can be then assigned to users and saved. Still these roles won’t be used until a name of the user they are defined for matches the “users” regexp.', '# Authorization\n\nHaving defined the 3 scopes (i.e. instance, space and project), we need to learn how to control what operations a user can perform on entities that belong to these scopes. This aspect in openBIS is controlled with “roles”. There are 4 roles available:\n\n```\nOBSERVER - can see objects in a given scope\nUSER - as OBSERVER + can create/update objects in a given scope\nPOWER_USER -  as USER + can delete objects in a given scope\nADMIN - as POWER_USER + update/delete the scope itself + assign rights within the scope\n```\n\nThe above roles together with instance, space and project scopes that we have defined earlier give us the following combinations:']","Authorization in openBIS is the system that determines whether a user can perform specific actions (like creating, reading, updating, or deleting data) on resources such as spaces, projects, experiments, or datasets. It operates through three main **scopes** (instance, space, and project) and four **roles** that define access levels:  

1. **Scopes**:  
   - **Instance-level**: Grants access to all spaces and projects in the openBIS system.  
   - **Space-level**: Restricts access to entities within a specific space.  
   - **Project-level**: (Optional, enabled via configuration) Limits access to entities within a specific project.  

2. **Roles**:  
   - **OBSERVER**: Can view data but cannot edit or delete.  
   - **USER**: Can create/update data but cannot delete.  
   - **POWER_USER**: Can delete data but cannot manage the scope itself.  
   - **ADMIN**: Full control, including managing the scope and assigning permissions.  

Authorization is managed by assigning roles to users or user groups, which simplifies administration. For example, adding a user to a group with ""ADMIN"" role on a project scope grants them full control over that project’s data. Project-level scope requires explicit configuration in the system’s settings to activate. This structure ensures granular, scalable access control tailored to organizational needs.","Authorization is a logic that decides whether a given user is allowed to perform a given operation on a given resource.

     - **Columns**: ""All (default order)"" to preserve table structure for import.  
     - **Rows**: ""Current Page"" or ""All Pages"" to control exported data volume.  
     - **Include Dependencies**: ""Yes"" to export related vocabularies or scripts (e.g., validation plugins).  
   - Exported files are Excel spreadsheets and may need renaming or reorganization before uploading to GitHub or another system.  

2. **Jython Scripts**:  
   - For advanced use, master data can be exported via Jython scripts, which also handle dependencies and validation scripts (exported as ZIP files).  

### **Importing Master Data**  
- **Admin UI**: Import exported files to another openBIS instance, ensuring compatibility with the target system’s structure.  
- **Automated Scripts**: Master data scripts can be run automatically during system startup if placed in core plugins (e.g., `$INSTALL_PATH/servers/core-plugins/<module>/as/initialize-master-data.py`). These scripts execute in alphabetical order of module names.

It is particularly useful for handling large volumes of data by grouping datasets into chunks, ensuring they are stored as a unified archive.  

Here’s how it works:  
1. **Archiving Process**: When datasets are selected for archiving, they are verified for size and stored as a single container file on the destination storage.  
2. **Mapping Database**: A PostgreSQL database is used to track which datasets are contained in which archive files, enabling efficient retrieval later.  
3. **Unarchiving Rules**: When restoring data, the system ensures consistency by checking the archive’s contents against the original datasets.  
4. **Workflows**: It supports workflows like the *Simple workflow*, where datasets are directly archived, sanity-checked, and mapped to the database. Other workflows may involve staging or replication steps.  
5. **Configuration**: To use it, existing archivers must be disabled, and the system must be configured with the `multi-dataset-archiver` plugin, along with settings for the archive destination, scratch space, and database.

1. **Review and Adjust Configuration Files**:  
   - Check the Application Server configuration file at `$INSTALL_PATH/servers/openBIS-server/jetty/etc/service.properties`. Ensure all mandatory database settings (starting with `database.`) are correctly defined. Inline comments in this file provide guidance.  
   - Verify the data store server (DSS) configuration to ensure it aligns with your setup.  

2. **Database Setup**:  
   - Confirm that the database settings (e.g., host, port, credentials) in `service.properties` are accurate. The openBIS server will create the `openbis_prod` database on startup if it doesn’t already exist.  

3. **Start the Servers**:  
   - Launch the Application Server first using:  
     ```bash
     <installation folder>/bin/bisup.sh
     ```  
     This initializes the database and checks authentication services.  
   - Start the Data Store Server afterward with:  
     ```bash
     <installation folder>/bin/dssup.sh
     ```  
     Alternatively, use a single command to start both sequentially.  

4. **First User Permissions**:  
   - The first user to log in will automatically be assigned the `INSTANCE_ADMIN` role, granting full administrative rights.  

5. **Monitor Logs**:  
   - Check logs in `<installation folder>/servers/openBIS-server/jetty/logs` for startup details or errors. Use `<installation folder>/bin/bislog.sh` to view logs interactively.

Here’s how they work:

1. **Mapping Identifiers to Archives**:  
   Share IDs are associated with specific experiment or data identifiers (e.g., `/MAIER/DEFAULT/EXP1`). These IDs determine which archive folder (e.g., `/net/miller/archive`) is used for storing related data. For example, the identifier `/MAIER/DEFAULT/EXP1` uses Share IDs `7` and `2`, which point to the archive folder `/net/miller/archive`.

2. **Group-Specific Disk Allocation**:  
   Each group in a facility instance is assigned a unique **share** (a symbolic link to an NFS directory) and one or more **Share IDs**. This ensures groups have dedicated disk space on the DSS store. For instance, the group `/SMITH` might use Share ID `6` to access its designated archive folder (`/net/smith/openbis/archive-big` or `/net/smith/openbis/archive-small` depending on data size).

3. **Configuration and Permissions**:  
   Share IDs are configured in the DSS store’s `shareIds` list and linked to specific NFS directories. This setup ensures that only authorized groups (via their Share IDs) can access their allocated storage, maintaining data isolation and security.

4. **Handling Large Data Sets**:  
   When a dataset is labeled as ""big,"" it is directed to a specific archive path (e.g., `/net/smith/openbis/archive-big`) using the corresponding Share ID, while smaller datasets use a different path. This allows efficient management of storage resources based on data size.

In summary, Share IDs act as a bridge between identifiers, archive folders, and group-specific storage, ensuring proper data organization and access control in facility instances.",An openBIS instance for a facility often needs the possibility that each customer can have its one disk space in the data store. This means a mapping is needed to decided in eager shuffling (by using MappingBasedShareFinder) and archiving (see Archiver for Facilities) to which share and which archive the data set should go.,0.9999999999,1.0,1.0,0.8613221416678543,0.4674147203417695,116

There is a maintenance task that runs in the background at configured frequency. This can be once per day or several times per day. If there are new users, they will be added to openBIS when the maintenance task runs.\n\nAn *instance admin* can assign additional roles to users from the admin interface ([User Registration](user-registration.html)). Default roles defined in the user management configuration file and automatically assigned cannot be removed, because they will be assigned again automatically by openBIS when the maintenance task runs.\n\nWe would recommend to assign *SPACE\\_USER* rights for the Inventory Spaces to every group user and *SPACE\\_ADMIN* rights for their own lab notebook. This can be specified in the user management configuration file on *system level*.']","To manage user groups in a multi-group openBIS instance, the following requirements must be met:  

1. **Group and Space Configuration**:  
   - Define a prefix for each group (e.g., `group_prefix`).  
   - Create dedicated spaces for each group, including:  
     - `group_prefix_MATERIALS`, `group_prefix_METHODS`, `group_prefix_STORAGE`, `group_prefix_STOCK_CATALOG`, `group_prefix_STOCK_ORDERS`, and `group_prefix_Username` (for individual users).  
   - Create the `group_prefix_ELN_SETTINGS` space and its sub-project `group_prefix_STORAGES` and collection `Group_prefix_STORAGES_COLLECTION`.  

2. **Rights Assignment**:  
   - Assign **SPACE_USER** rights to the group’s inventory spaces (`MATERIALS`, `METHODS`, etc.) for standard access.  
   - Grant **SPACE_ADMIN** rights to the group’s lab notebook space (`group_prefix_ELN_SETTINGS`) for administrative control.  
   - Assign **SPACE_OBSERVER** rights to `group_prefix_STOCK_ORDERS` for read-only access.  
   - Ensure users are added to the `group_prefix_USER` group and admins to the `group_prefix_ADMIN` group.  

3. **Maintenance Tasks**:  
   - Configure the **UserManagementMaintenanceTask** on the AS (Application Server) to automatically register users and assign roles based on the configuration file.  
   - Set up the **EagerShufflingTask** on the DSS (Data Store Server) to segment data by group and manage disk space allocation.  
   - Optionally, enable the **UsageReportingTask** on AS to generate regular usage reports.  

4. **Disk Space Management**:  
   - Allocate separate disk shares for each group on the DSS to ensure isolation and resource management.  

5. **Role Persistence**:  
   - Default roles defined in the configuration file cannot be removed, as they are automatically reapplied by openBIS during maintenance tasks.  

These steps ensure secure, scalable, and automated user group management across multiple teams in a shared openBIS instance.",Running openBIS as a facility means that different groups share the same openBIS instance.

1. **Docker Container Setup (Production-Ready):**  
   We strongly recommend running openBIS as a lightweight Docker container for portability and flexibility. This setup uses a **three-container architecture**:  
   - **openbis-ingress**: A reverse HTTP proxy to manage and secure client requests.  
   - **openbis-app**: Runs the Java-based openBIS Application Server (AS) and Data Store Server (DSS).  
   - **openbis-db**: A PostgreSQL database container to handle data transactions.  

2. **Native Installation (Linux/macOS):**  
   For non-containerized deployments, openBIS is optimized for **AMD64 (x86_64) architecture**. While ARM support is under development, Linux and macOS are currently the supported operating systems.  

Both approaches ensure scalability, but the Docker setup is ideal for production environments due to its streamlined management and cross-platform compatibility.

Here's a structured guide:

### **Hardware Requirements (Big Scenario)**
- **CPU:** 4–8 modern x86 cores  
- **Memory:** 16 GB total  
  - **OS:** 3 GB  
  - **PostgreSQL:** 3 GB  
  - **openBIS Application Server:** 8 GB  
  - **openBIS Data Store Server:** 2 GB  

This configuration supports over 20 concurrent users and ensures smooth operation for larger workloads. PostgreSQL memory settings should be tuned using tools like [pgtune.leopard.in.ua](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) for optimal performance.

### **Key Configuration Tasks**
1. **Mail Server Setup**  
   - Configure the `UsageReportingTask` to send weekly usage reports:  
     ```properties
     mail.from = openbis@<host>
     mail.smtp.host = <SMTP host>
     ```  
   - Ensure the task runs nightly (e.g., at 1:15 AM) and sends reports to specified addresses.

2. **LDAP Integration**  
   - Set up LDAP for user management:  
     ```properties
     ldap.server.url = <LDAP server URL>
     ldap.security.principal.distingished.name = <principal DN>
     ldap.security.principal.password = <password>
     ldap.searchBase = <search base DN>
     ```  
   - This enables centralized user authentication and synchronization.

3. **Harvester Service**  
   - Ensure the `HarvesterMaintenanceTask` is configured to sync master data, updating entities based on modification timestamps and using the `translate-using-data-source-alias` flag for namespace management.

### **Best Practices**
- Regularly monitor resource usage and adjust allocations as needed.  
- Back up PostgreSQL configurations and ensure redundancy for critical services.  
- Test LDAP and mail server configurations in a staging environment before deploying to production.

This reporting plugin works only for one data set.\n\n**Configuration**:']","Implementing **Reporting and Processing Plugins** using **Jython** in openBIS is streamlined by leveraging script-based logic instead of Java classes. Here's how it works:

---

### **1. Core Implementation**
- **Jython Scripts**: Replace Java classes (`IReportingPluginTask`/`IProcessingPluginTask`) with a single method in a Jython script. The script gains access to services for:
  - Data retrieval (e.g., querying datasets).
  - Table creation (for reporting).
  - Email sending (for notifications).

---

### **2. Configuration**
All Jython-based plugins require a `plugin.properties` file with these key settings:

#### **Example: Jython-Based Reporting Plugin**
```properties
label = Jython Reporting
dataset-types = HCS_IMAGE
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.dss.generic.server.plugins.jython.JythonBasedReportingPlugin
script-path = data-set-reporting.py
```

#### **Example: Jython-Based Processing Plugin**
```properties
label = Jython Processing
dataset-types = HCS_IMAGE
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.dss.generic.server.plugins.jython.JythonBasedProcessingPlugin
script-path = data-set-processing.py
```

- **`script-path`**: Specifies the Jython script file (e.g., `data-set-reporting.py`).
- **`dataset-types`**: Defines which dataset types the plugin applies to (optional for ingestion services).
- **`lib/` folder**: Add third-party JARs here for dependencies.

---

### **3. Special Use Cases**
#### **Aggregation Services**
- **Jython Aggregation Reporting**:
  ```properties
  label = Jython Aggregation Reporting
  class = ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.dss.generic.server.plugins.jython.JythonAggregationService
  script-path = aggregating.py
  ```
- **Jython Ingestion Service**:
  ```properties
  label = Jython Ingestion
  class = ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.dss.generic.server.plugins.jython.JythonIngestionService
  script-path = processing.py
  ```
  - No `dataset-types` needed here.

#### **Code Reuse with Reporting-Based Processing**
- Use `ReportingBasedProcessingPlugin` to reuse a reporting script for both reporting and processing:
  - The script generates a table, which the plugin converts to text and emails as an attachment.
  - Configure with `service.properties` for email details (e.g., subject, recipients).

---

### **4. Key Benefits**
- **Simplified Development**: Avoid Java coding; use Python-like syntax.
- **Flexibility**: Reuse scripts across reporting and processing tasks.
- **Integration**: Leverage openBIS services for data and email workflows.

1. **Data Management**:  
   - You can store data externally (on your file system) and manage it freely, without being tied to openBIS’s internal storage.  
   - **Metadata** (like sample details, provenance, or experimental notes) is sent to openBIS for tracking, ensuring data is linked to its context and history.  

2. **Efficient Tools**:  
   - oBIS leverages **git** and **git-annex** to track datasets. This allows efficient handling of even large binary files (e.g., raw data files) without bloating the system.  

3. **Integration with openBIS**:  
   - It communicates with openBIS via its API to register metadata, enabling features like provenance tracking and data lineage.  

4. **Usage**:  
   - It’s a standalone tool, requiring only that you add it to your system’s `PATH` for access.  
   - Commands like `download` or `upload` connect to your openBIS instance, using your configured username (and prompting for a password when needed).

Here's a breakdown of its core components and relationships:

1. **Space**: The top-level entity, representing a logical grouping (e.g., a lab or institute). Each Space has a *Code* and *Description*.
2. **Project**: A sub-entity under a Space, used to organize related research activities. Projects also have a *Code* and *Description*.
3. **Experiment/Collection**: A container within a Project, used to group related data or experiments. These can have *user-defined properties* to capture specific metadata.
4. **Object**: A key entity that represents physical or digital items (e.g., samples, equipment, or experimental steps). Objects can belong to a Space, Project, or Experiment/Collection, and they also support *user-defined properties*.
5. **Dataset**: A folder within an Experiment/Collection or Object, used to store data files. Datasets can have *user-defined properties* and are where files are uploaded (e.g., via the web UI or APIs).

**Key Relationships**:
- **Spaces** contain **Projects**.
- **Projects** contain **Experiments/Collections**.
- **Experiments/Collections** can contain **Objects** and **Datasets**.
- **Objects** can be shared across Spaces or nested within hierarchical levels.
- **Datasets** are tied to **Experiments/Collections** or **Objects** and hold immutable data files.

This structure allows for flexible, granular organization of data while ensuring traceability and metadata management.

It provides a visual tree-like menu to navigate through key components like **Spaces, Projects, Experiments/Collections, Objects, and Datasets**. 

### Key Features:
1. **Filtering**: You can filter the menu by the **name or code** of entities to quickly locate specific items.  
2. **Navigation**: Clicking on nodes expands them, and selecting an entry opens its details in a JSON format (for preview purposes).  
3. **Root Node Customization**: If you want to focus on a specific section, you can set a **root node** to collapse the menu around that area. This helps streamline navigation for targeted tasks.  
4. **Scroll Behavior**: By default, the menu scrolls to highlight selected entries, but you can disable this behavior if needed.  

This feature was introduced in **openBIS 20.10.5** and further enhanced in **20.10.6** with improvements like the new navigation component and refined filtering options. It’s designed to simplify administrative tasks by providing a structured, searchable view of the data hierarchy.

Here's how it works:

1. **System-Level Setup**:  
   Archiving to platforms like Strongbox or StronLink requires configuration at the system level. This involves setting up the necessary infrastructure and ensuring the archiver is properly integrated with your storage solution.

2. **Manual Archiving**:  
   - Users can manually trigger archiving from the ELN (Electronic Lab Notebook) interface.  
   - The **""Archive""** and **""Unarchive""** buttons must be enabled by an instance admin or group admin (in multi-group instances) via the ELN Settings.  
   - The Unarchiving helper tool is also enabled in these settings to facilitate recovery of archived datasets.

3. **Automated Archiving**:  
   The **Auto Archiver** automates the process by selecting datasets based on predefined policies (e.g., datasets not accessed in a while or tagged for archiving). While it doesn’t perform the actual archiving, it streamlines the selection of candidates for archiving. Policies are configured using parameters like `policy.class` and other related properties.

4. **Configuration Parameters**:  
   - `archiver.hdf5-files-in-data-set`: Controls how HDF5 files (e.g., thumbnails) are handled during archiving.  
   - `archiver.with-sharding`: Determines whether datasets are stored in a sharded structure or a single directory in the long-term storage.

Here's a structured approach based on the provided context:

---

### **1. System-Level Configuration**
- **Shared IDs Setup**: Configure the system to allow multiple groups to coexist by defining shared IDs. This ensures each group sees only their own Spaces and data. Refer to the [shared IDs documentation](../../../system-documentation/configuration/share-ids.html) for detailed steps.
- **Group Prefixes**: Define a unique prefix for each group (e.g., `RDM`, `ETHRDH`). This prefix is used to namespace Spaces, projects, and collections.

---

### **2. Manual Entity Creation**
#### **Spaces**
- Create the following Spaces for each group:
  - `group_prefix_MATERIALS`
  - `group_prefix_METHODS`
  - `group_prefix_ELN_SETTINGS`
  - `group_prefix_STORAGE`
  - `group_prefix_STOCK_CATALOG`
  - `group_prefix_STOCK_ORDERS`
  - `group_prefix_Username` (for user-specific Spaces)

#### **Projects & Collections**
- Create the project: `/group_prefix_ELN_SETTINGS/group_prefix_STORAGES`
- Set up the collection: `/group_prefix_ELN_SETTINGS/group_prefix_STORAGES/Group_prefix_STORAGES_COLLECTION` (type: COLLECTION)

---

### **3. Rights Management**
- **User Groups**:
  - Create `group_prefix_User` and `group_prefix_ADMIN` groups.
  - Assign **SPACE_USER** rights to group members for:
    - `group_prefix_MATERIALS`
    - `group_prefix_METHODS`
    - `group_prefix_STORAGE`
    - `group_prefix_STOCK_CATALOG`
  - Assign **SPACE_OBSERVER** rights to:
    - `group_prefix_ELN_SETTINGS`
    - `group_prefix_STOCK_ORDERS`
- **Admin Rights**: Grant `group_prefix_ADMIN` **SPACE_ADMIN** rights to relevant folders (e.g., ELN_SETTINGS, STORAGES).

---

### **4. ELN Settings Customization**
- **Group-Specific Settings**: A *group admin* or *instance admin* can customize ELN settings (e.g., storage configurations, templates) via the **Settings** menu. Select the group from the dropdown to adjust:
  - **Storages**: Define sample storage locations.
  - **Templates**: Create object templates for Materials, Methods, etc.
  - **Object Types**: Extend definitions for custom data types.

---

### **5. Optional: Disable User Spaces**
- If a group prefers organizing notebooks by projects instead of users, configure the system to **exclude user Spaces** for that group (see [share-ids documentation](../../../system-documentation/configuration/share-ids.html)).

Unlike\ncustom columns and filters (which also require Jython syntax), dynamic\nproperties can have more than one line of code. If the Script contains\nonly one line, it will be evaluated and used as the value of appropriate\ndynamic property. If on the other hand a multi line script is needed,\nthe function named `""calculate""` will be expected and the the result\nwill be used as property value.\n\nTo access the entity object from the script, use the following syntax:\n\n`entity.<requested method>`\n\nCurrently available methods that can be called on all kinds of entities\ninclude:\n\n* `code()`\n* `property(propertyTypeCode)`\n* `propertyValue(propertyTypeCode)`\n* `propertyRendered(propertyTypeCode)`\n* `properties()`', ""## Dynamic Properties\n\n### Creating scripts\n\nYou can test your script on selected entities\n(samples/experiments/materials/data sets) using the testing environment\n\n* part of `Script Editor`.\n\n#### Simple Examples\n\n1. Show a value of a Sample property which is named ‘Multiplicity’\n\n```\nentity.propertyValue('Multiplicity')\n```\n\n2. Takes an existing property and multiplies the value by 1.5\n\n```\nfloat(entity.propertyValue('CONCENTRATION_ORIGINAL_ILLUMINA'))*1.5\n```\n\n#### Advanced Examples\n\n1. Show all entity properties as one dynamic property:"", '## Managed Properties\n\n### Creating scripts\n\nAll functions (except `batchColumnNames and` `inputWidgets` )  have\naccess to a variable named `property` which holds an object of type\n`IManagedProperty`. Methods of this class are explained below. To\naccess the property object from the script, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nproperty.<requested method>\n```\n\n#### Predefined Functions\n\nThe following functions are predefined and can be used everywhere in the\nscript:\n\n* `ISimpleTableModelBuilderAdaptor createTableBuilder()`: Creates a\n  table model builder. It will be used in `configureUI` to create\n  tabular data to be shown in openBIS GUI.\n\n* `ValidationException ValidationException(String message)`: Creates a\n  Validation Exception with specified message which should be raised\n  in functions `updateFromUI` and `updateFromBatchInput` in case of\n  invalid input.']","Properties Handled By Scripts in openBIS are used to customize how specific properties are managed or calculated, ensuring data consistency and enabling complex logic. There are two main types:

1. **Dynamic Properties**  
   These are properties whose values are automatically calculated using existing metadata (e.g., other properties of the same entity). Scripts define expressions or functions to compute their values. For example, a script might multiply a concentration value by 1.5 or retrieve a related property like ""Multiplicity."" Dynamic properties are read-only and evaluated in real-time when data is accessed.

2. **Managed Properties**  
   These properties are indirectly modified by users through scripts. Scripts define how the property behaves, such as validating input, formatting data, or generating tabular outputs. For instance, a script might enforce validation rules (e.g., checking if a value is within a range) or create a table builder for displaying data in the openBIS GUI.

**Key Use Cases:**  
- Automating calculations based on existing data.  
- Enforcing business rules or data validation.  
- Customizing user interactions with properties (e.g., dynamic UI elements).  

Scripts for these properties are written in Jython and can be tested directly within the openBIS Script Editor. This approach streamlines data management while maintaining flexibility for advanced workflows.","One of the reasons why openBIS is easily extensible and adjustible is the concept of generic entities like samples, experiments, materials and data sets. By adding domain specific properties to the mentioned objects, instance administrator creates a data model specific to given field of study. Values of configured properties will be defined by the user upon creation or update of the entities (samples etc.).",0.99999999998,1.0,0.75,0.7603629546063374,0.49577992205847,164

What system does openBIS support for Data Archiving?,"['## 8. Rationale for obisData-provenance tracking tools like openBIS make it possible to understand and follow the research\nprocess. What was studied, what data was acquired and how, how was data analyzed to arrive at final\nresults for publication – this is information that is captured in openBIS. In the standard usage\nscenario, openBIS stores and manages data directly. This has the advantage that openBIS acts as a\ngatekeeper to the data, making it easy to keep backups or enforce access restrictions, etc. However,\nthis way of working is not a good solution for all situations.\n\nSome research groups work with large amounts of data (e.g., multiple TB), which makes it inefficient\nand impractical to give openBIS control of the data. Other research groups require that data be\nstored on a shared file system under a well-defined directory structure, be it for historical\nreasons or because of the tools they use. In this case as well, it is difficult to give openBIS full\ncontrol of the data.', '# openBIS Command Line Tool (oBIS)oBIS is a command-line tool that makes it possible to handle data sets tracked by OpenBIS,\nwhere users have complete freedom to structure and manipulate the data as they wish, while retaining\nthe benefits of openBIS.\n\nWith oBIS, it is possible not only to handle datasets stored in OpenBIS but also available to keep\nonly metadata send to openBIS, while the data itself is managed externally, by the user. In this\ncase, OpenBIS is aware of its existence and the data can be used for provenance tracking.', '## 5.2 External Data StoreExternal Data Store mode allows for orderly management of data in\nconditions that require great flexibility. oBIS makes it possible to track data on a file system,\nwhere users have complete freedom to structure and manipulate the data as they wish, while retaining\nthe benefits of openBIS. With oBIS, only metadata is actually stored and managed by openBIS. The\ndata itself is managed externally, by the user, but openBIS is aware of its existence and the data\ncan be used for provenance tracking.\n\nUnder the covers, obis takes advantage of publicly available and tested tools to manage data on the\nfile system. In particular, it uses git and git-annex to track the content of a dataset. Using\ngit-annex, even large binary artifacts can be tracked efficiently. For communication with openBIS,\nobis uses the openBIS API, which offers the power to register and track all metadata supported by\nopenBIS.', '## Manual archiving\n\n### openBIS core UIArchiving can be triggered by doing the following steps:\n\n* go to an experiment/collection or an object.\n* switch to the tab “Data Sets”.

In the standard usage\nscenario, openBIS stores and manages data directly. This has the advantage that openBIS acts as a\ngatekeeper to the data, making it easy to keep backups or enforce access restrictions, etc. However,\nthis way of working is not a good solution for all situations.\n\nSome research groups work with large amounts of data (e.g., multiple TB), which makes it inefficient\nand impractical to give openBIS control of the data. Other research groups require that data be\nstored on a shared file system under a well-defined directory structure, be it for historical\nreasons or because of the tools they use. In this case as well, it is difficult to give openBIS full\ncontrol of the data.', '## Allocate storage positions to samplesIf we want to track the storage position of samples, openBIS provides a\ngraphical overview of lab storages.\n\nLab storages need to be configured by a *lab manager* or *group admin*,\nas explained here: [Configure Lab\nStorage](../general-admin-users/admins-documentation/customise-inventory-of-materials-and-samples.html#configure-lab-storage)\n\nThis can be done in two ways:\n\n1. add storage information on the sample form during (or after) sample\n   registration\n2. batch register storage positions for several samples\n\n\n\n### Register storage position for a single sample1.

Here’s how it works:  

1. **Storage Configuration**: Lab managers or group admins configure storage locations (e.g., refrigerators, freezers, shelves) through the openBIS interface. These storage areas are linked to samples to ensure accurate tracking.  

2. **Individual Sample Assignment**: When registering a sample, users can manually assign it to a specific storage position via the ""Storage"" section of the sample form. This involves selecting or creating a storage location and linking it to the sample.  

3. **Batch Registration**: For multiple samples, storage positions can be assigned en masse using a TSV template. This method streamlines the process by:  
   - Downloading a template file.  
   - Removing the identifier column (to let openBIS auto-generate IDs).  
   - Specifying parent sample IDs (to link storage positions to existing samples).  
   - Filling in details like storage location, date, and conditions.  
   - Uploading the file via the ""Batch Registration"" tool.  

4. **Graphical Overview**: openBIS offers a visual map of lab storages, making it easy to locate samples based on their assigned storage positions.

What are Jupyter Notebooks in the context of data analysis?,"['## Jupyter Notebook Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform that combines live code, equations, narrative text, visualizations, interactive dashboards and other media. Jupyter Notebooks can be used to analyze data stored in an openBIS instance.', 'Question: What are Jupyter Notebooks and how can they be used to analyze data in the Data Store? Answer: [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a web-based interactive computing platform that combines live code, equations, narrative text, visualizations etc. The Jupyter system currently supports over 100 programming languages including Python, Java, R, Julia, Matlab, Octave and many more. Jupyter Notebooks can be used to analyze data stored in an openBIS instance, e.g., by connecting a local Jupyter installation with the Data Store. The output of the analysis and the notebooks themselves can then be saved in the Data Store and connected to the dataset they are based on. It is possible to download an [extension for JupyterLab](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jupyterlab-openbis) that adds three buttons to a default notebook to 1. connect to an openBIS instance, 2. download datasets from the openBIS instance, 3. upload the notebook to the openBIS instance.

They’re widely used for tasks like data cleaning, statistical analysis, and machine learning. In the context of openBIS and the BAM Data Store, they serve as a powerful way to analyze datasets stored in these systems.  

Here’s how they work in this context:  
1. **Integration with openBIS**: You can connect a Jupyter Notebook to an openBIS instance to access datasets, run analyses, and save results. The notebook itself can be stored back in openBIS as a dataset (often of type *ANALYSIS_NOTEBOOK*), linked to the data it analyzed.  
2. **Flexibility**: Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages (like Python, R, Java) and lets you mix code with narrative text, making it ideal for documenting workflows.  
3. **Tools for Analysis**: Researchers often use Python libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib) alongside tools like **pyBIS** (a Python module for openBIS) or the **JupyterLab extension** (for direct openBIS integration).  
4. **Saving Work**: After analysis, notebooks can be saved to openBIS, tied to specific experiments or objects, ensuring results are versioned and accessible.
