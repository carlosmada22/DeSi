# Tutorials

Hands-on guides that walk through running DeSi locally, preparing data, and issuing your first question. These tutorials assume you are working from the project root.

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md): install, prerequisites, and initial setup.
- [Run Locally](run-locally.md): what the workflow does on disk and how to rerun it safely.
- [First Query](first-query.md): talk to the chatbot from the terminal and interpret sources.
