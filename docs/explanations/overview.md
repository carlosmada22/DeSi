# Overview

DeSi (DataStore Helper) is a retrieval-augmented assistant for two knowledge bases: openBIS ReadTheDocs and BAM Data Store Wiki.js. It answers questions with cited context pulled from a local ChromaDB vector store and generated by an Ollama LLM.

Key ideas:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: answers are grounded in stored chunks; sources are surfaced alongside responses.
- **Local-first**: scraping, embeddings, vector DB, and chat history stay on disk; no external API calls.
- **Composable pipeline**: scrapers, processors, and query engine are decoupled so each stage can be run independently.
- **Conversation-aware**: LangGraph workflow rewrites follow-up questions and keeps recent history in SQLite.
